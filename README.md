# CS247- Final Project
## TeamId - 16

The project aims to consider the impact of embeddings on recommendation. For this purpose, we utilized MovieLens-1M dataset and generated movie embeddings using BERT and Word2Vec to assess the performance of our recommendation system. As an extension, we also explored GNNs on MovieLens-100K dataset to compare the performance.

A quick introduction about the models used:
 - We used two types of models: DeepFM and GNNs for our project.

Evaluation of the recommendation system:
- Metrics used: RMSE and MAE
